Repository created to learn how to use GitHub

Good Morning Team,

I am editing this file to get a grasp on learning GitHub. I think that learning GitHub will be essential to not only my growth as a programmer, but also essential to creating a career in programming. My current position has been satisfying in terms of learning opportunities and compensation, but I must continue to grow.

Let's commit this :D.
